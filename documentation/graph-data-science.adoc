== Neo4j Graph Data Science

The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library contains a set of graph algorithms, exposed through Cypher procedures.  Graph algorithms provide insights into the graph structure and elements, for example, by computing centrality, similarity scores, and detecting communities.  The GDS library is divided into three tiers of maturity: product, beta, and alpha.

This guide demonstrates the usual workflow for how to run production-tier algorithms.  The generalized workflow is as follows:app-name: 

* How to create a graph projection (also referred to as an "in-memory graph")
* How graph projections are used to run a graph algorithm with GDS
* Examples of running a few graph algorithms and interpretation of their results

The official GDS library documentation can be found link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[here^].

== Graph Model

Before you run any of the algorithms, you need to import your data.  We will be working with an example dataset that shows the connections between different airports across the world. Note that we have 5 different node labels (`Airport`, `City`, `Country`, `Continent`, and `Region`) and 5 different relationship types (`:HAS_ROUTE`, `:IN_CITY`, `:IN_COUNTRY`, `:IN_REGION`, and `:ON_CONTINENT`).

== Loading the data

We will use the Cypher command `LOAD CSV` to import our data into Neo4j from CSV file hosted on GitHub.  It will parse a CSV file line by line as objects that can then be manipulated using Cypher.  

We begin by creating uniqeness constraints on each of the nodes, which make for efficient queries.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT airports ON (a:Airport) ASSERT a.iata IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT cities ON (c:City) ASSERT c.name IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT regions ON (r:Region) ASSERT r.name IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT countries ON (c:Country) ASSERT c.code IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT continents ON (c:Continent) ASSERT c.code IS UNIQUE;
----

Next we will import the Airport, Country, and Continent nodes and set their properties.

*_Redo this section such that we do not populate airport nodes with properties that then get used for nodes_*

[source,cypher]
----
WITH 
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cj2001/bite_sized_data_science/main/data/airport-node-list.csv'
    AS url
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM url AS row
MERGE (a:Airport {iata: row.iata})
SET a.id = row.id,
    a.icao = row.icao,
    a.city = row.city,
    a.descr = row.descr,
    a.region = row.region,
    a.runways = toInteger(row.runways),
    a.longest = toInteger(row.longest),
    a.altitude = toInteger(row.altitude),
    a.country = row.country,
    a.continent = row.continent,
    a.lat = toFloat(row.lat),
    a.lon = toFloat(row.lon);

WITH 
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cj2001/bite_sized_data_science/main/data/country-node-list.csv'
    AS url
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM url AS row
MERGE (c:Country {code: row.code})
SET c.descr = row.descr;

WITH 
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cj2001/bite_sized_data_science/main/data/continent-node-list.csv'
    AS url
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM url AS row
MERGE (c:Continent {code: row.code})
SET c.descr = row.descr;
----

Finally, we will import all of our relationships.  Note that some of the relationships only exist in the Airport nodes list (in the CSV file).  We will use these to artifically create the City and Region nodes as well as the relationships between them and the Airport, Country, and Continent nodes.  Note that the `(Airport)-[:HAS_ROUTE]-(Airport)` relationship has a relationship property of `distance`, indicating the distance between each of the airports.  We will later use this to create weighted graphs.

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cj2001/bite_sized_data_science/main/data/iroutes-edges.csv' AS row
MATCH (source:Airport {iata: row.src})
MATCH (target:Airport {iata: row.dest})
MERGE (source)-[r:HAS_ROUTE]->(target)
ON CREATE SET r.distance = toInteger(row.dist);

MATCH (a:Airport)
MERGE (c:City {name: a.city})
MERGE (a)-[:IN_CITY]->(c);

MATCH (a:Airport)
MERGE (r:Region {name: a.region})
MERGE (a)-[:IN_REGION]->(r);

MATCH (a:Airport)
MERGE (c:City {name: a.city})
MERGE (c)-[:IN_REGION]->(r);

MATCH (a:Airport)
MATCH (c:Country {code: a.country})

MATCH (co:Continent {code: a.continent})
MERGE (c)-[:ON_CONTINENT]->(co);

== Data visualization

Prior to running some algorithms, it is helpful to visualize our data.  In order to do so, running the following query, which will give you the schema of the graph:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

Using this command, we can see our 5 different node and relationship types.

== Summary statistics

Prior to using any of the GDS algorithms it can be beneficial to calculate some summary statistics on the data.  For example, the following calculate the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of the number of flights out of each airport.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Airport)-[:HAS_ROUTE]->()
WITH a, count(*) AS num
RETURN min(num) AS min, max(num) AS max, avg(num) AS avg_routes, stdev(num) AS stdev
----

// Note that we cannot repeat the same query as in the original browser guide because that
// graph had a property of "book" in its relationship.  We do not have the equivalent in 
// this graph.

== Graph creation

The first step in executing any GDS algorithm is to create a graph projection (also referred to as an in-memory graph) under a user-defined name.  Graph projections are subsets of our full graph to be used in calculating results through the GDS algorithms.  Their use enables GDS to run quickly and efficiently through the calculations.  In the creation of these projections, the nature of the graph elements may change in the following ways:

* Nodes and relationship types might be renamed
* Several node or relationship types might be merged
* The direction of relationships might be changed
* Parallel relationships might be aggregated
* Relationships might be derived from larger patterns

// I am leaving out the mention of subgraphs since that is a pretty complex topic

Graph projections can be created through one of two methods: native projections and Cypher projections.  These graph projections are then stored in the graph catalog under a user-defined name.

== Graph catalog: creating a graph with native projections

Native projections provide the fastest performance for creating an graph projection.  They take 3 mandatory arguments: `graphName`, 'nodeProjection', and 'relationshipProjection'.  There are also optional `configuration` parameters that can be used to further configure the graph.  In general, the syntax for creating a native projection is:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.project(
    graphName: String,
    nodeProjection: String or List or Map,
    relationshipProjection: String or List or Map,
    configuration: Map
)
YIELD
  graphName: String,
  nodeProjection: Map,
  nodeCount: Integer,
  relationshipProjection: Map,
  relationshipCount: Integer,
  projectMillis: Integer,
  createMillis: Integer
----

For example, in our dataset, we could create a graph projection of the routes between all airports as:

[source,cypher]
----
UPDATE
----

== Example of a native projection



== Graph catalog: creating a graph with Cypher projections

== Graph catalog: listing and existence

It is helpful to know which graphs are in the catalog and their properties.  To see this for all graphs, you use

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
----

You can also check this for an individual graph using:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list('graph-name')
----

where `graph-name` is the name of your projected, in-memory graph.


== Graph catalog: dropping a graph

Once you are done using a projected graph, it is beneficial to drop it from the catalog in order to free up memory space.  This can be achieved by using:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('graph-name')
----

where `graph-name` is the name of your projected, in-memory graph.

== Getting started with algorithms

== Algorithm syntax: available execution modes

Once you have created a named graph projection, there are 4 different execution modes provided for each algorithm:

* `stream`: Returns the results of the algorithm as a stream of records without altering the database
* `write`: Writes the results of the algorithm to the Neo4j database and returns a single record of summary statistics
* `mutate`: Writes the results of the algorithm to the projected graph and returns a single record of summary statistics
* `stats`: Returns a single record of summary statistics but does not write to either the Neo4j database or the projected graph 

In addition to the above for modes, it is possible to use `estimate` to obtain an estimation of how much memory a given algorithm will use.

== Algorithm syntax: general algorithm use

Utilizing one of the 4 different execution modes, the general way to call a graph algorithm is as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds[.<tier>].<algorithm>.<execution-mode>[.<estimate>](
  graphName: String,
  configuration: Map
)
----

where items in `[]` are optional.  From the above, `<tier>`, if present, indicates whether the algorithm is in the alpha or beta tier (production-tiered algorithms do not use this), `<algorithm>` is the name of the algorithm, `<execution-mode>` is one of the 4 execution modes, and `<estimate>` is an optional flag indicating that the estimate of memory usage should be returned.
